# WeatherVacationPy

For Module 6, we traveled :).  We traversed all over the globe through JSON data structures, discovering all kinds of cool meteorological relationships.  These relationships were analyzed for their correlation strength, or lack thereof.  Pearson’s r values and Linear Regression Equations were determined, and fun data plots dotted the landscape of  groovy red regression lines.  As a programming finale, our JSON traversals lead to the investigation of desirable vacation destinations (after bootcamp ends... and good job pays!!!).  Colorful geoViews dazzled, and hover messages delighted :).  I enjoyed the exercise immensely, and am now daydreaming of post-bootcamp adventures :).
